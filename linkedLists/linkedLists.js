// Linked Lists and their traversal

// The linked list is a linear data structure, a collection of data elements(nodes), =>
// in which each node points to the next 
// Each node contains data, and a reference to the next node(only the next node in a singly linked list)
// The benefits over something like an array, list elements can be easily inserted or removed => 
// without reallocation of the entire structure, as the elements aren't physically stored in memory
// Inherently accessed sequentially
