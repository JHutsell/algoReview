// Another useful technique in solving algorithms is the use of recursion
// Recursion can be thought of as a procedure that occurs within itself
// In terms of development, this can be thought of as a function that calls =>
// itself within another function call 

// The basic idea is that there are two properties, the base case and the recursive step
// The base case is the scenario where the function will terminate, and will stop the recursion
// The recursive step is the set of rules or processes that reduce each case towards the base case
